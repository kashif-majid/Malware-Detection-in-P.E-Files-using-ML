# Malware-Detection-in-P.E-Files-using-ML
• In this project we developed a Python script for malware detection using a classifier file produced during the training of a ML model for PE files
• We develop classifier models utilizing the retrieved feature set to divide dangerous and benign files from unknown PE files.
• To determine which model provides the highest accuracy, we train a variety of models on the feature set. To increase accuracy and efficiency, the feature set was built   by extracting features from the PE header.
• This is then used to determine whether the provided PE file is safe or harmful.
